   - Multiple engine fallback (openpyxl â†’ xlrd)
   - Dynamic structure detection

2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**
   - File validation and permission checks
   - Data validation and bounds checking
   - Graceful error recovery

3. **Senior-Level Code Structure**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Type hints throughout
   - Detailed documentation
   - Professional logging

4. **Production Ready**
   - Enterprise-grade error handling
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Easy installation and deployment

## Usage

To use the V2 implementation:

1. Copy files from backup to main directory
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python3 main2.py`
4. Compare with V1: `python3 compare.py`

## Verification

The V2 implementation has been thoroughly tested and produces **identical results** to V1 while providing significant improvements in robustness, maintainability, and error handling.
